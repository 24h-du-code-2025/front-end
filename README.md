# Frontend - AI ChatBot

Frontend implementation of the AI ChatBot that won the **["24 Heures du Code"](https://les24hducode.fr/)** hackathon.

## üèÜ Objective

The primary goal of the hackathon was to develop a chatbot to automate the reception process at **Hotel California**. Instead of clients having to ask hotel managers for information and make requests manually, they could interact with an AI-powered chatbot that handles basic management tasks seamlessly.

The hackathon organizers provided a pre-developed **REST API** for the Hotel California system. The chatbot's objective was to interpret user requests in natural language and translate them into appropriate API calls.
